<p>
    💞In the whispers of fate on a February morn, <br />
Two hearts met, a love story was born. <br />
On this day, back in 2001, <br />
A journey of love, a tale well-spun. <br />
</p>
<p>
    💕From that first glance, a spark took flight, <br />
A connection formed, so pure and bright. <br />
February 1, a date so divine, <br />
Marking the beginning of your love's design. <br />
</p>
<p>
    💖Through seasons of joy and moments of grace, <br />
Together you've journeyed, hand in embrace. <br />
From shared dreams to vows spoken true, <br />
Your love story deepened, ever anew. <br />
</p>
<p>
    💝In the tapestry of time, woven and spun, <br />
A daughter arrived, a cherished one. <br />
Her laughter, a melody in your home, <br />
In the garden of love, she beautifully roams. <br />
</p>
<p>
    ❣️As you celebrate this anniversary day, <br />
Cherish the memories along the way. <br />
Happy anniversary, dear Dheng and Grace, <br />
May your love story forever flame. <br />
</p>
