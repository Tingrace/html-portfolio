<h1>🌸 About Me 🌸</h1>

<p>Konnichiwa! I'm Kristine, a warm-hearted wife to my amazing husband Dheng and a dedicated mom to our precious daughter, Athea. Our little family is currently making beautiful memories in the scenic city of Chiba, Japan. 🏡</p>

<h3>Embracing the Architectural Journey 🏗️</h3>
<p>By profession, I am a licensed Architect, and my passion lies in crafting designs for cozy residential houses. I find joy in creating spaces that reflect both functionality and aesthetics, turning houses into homes. 🖌️.</p>

<h3>The Heart of My Home 🍲</h3>
<p>When I'm not immersed in the world of architecture, you'll often find me in the heart of our home - the kitchen. Cooking and baking are not just tasks for me; they are expressions of love and creativity. From experimenting with new recipes to crafting delightful treats for my loved ones, the kitchen is where I find my culinary sanctuary. 👩‍🍳</p>

<h3>A Journey into the World of Coding 💻</h3>
<p>In addition to my love for design and culinary arts, I'm currently on a journey of self-discovery in the realm of coding. Aspiring to become a Full Stack Engineer, I am navigating through the world of programming languages and frameworks, embracing the challenge and excitement of learning something new. 🚀</p>

<h3>Filipino Roots, Japanese Blooms 🌺</h3>
<p>Hailing from the vibrant culture of the Philippines, I bring a blend of warmth and hospitality wherever I go. Living in the Land of the Rising Sun has added a touch of serenity to my life, and I'm grateful for the unique experiences that come with being part of the Japanese community. 🌸</p>

<h3>Furry Friends on the Horizon 🐾</h3>
<p>One dream close to my heart is to welcome a furry friend into our home. Whether it's a playful dog or a charming cat, the prospect of having a loyal companion brings immense joy to my heart. 🐶😺</p>
